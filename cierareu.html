Abstract <br><br>
The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will use a coronagraph to block the glare of stars so
scientists can image orbiting planets that would otherwise be hidden. In preparation for this, we
examine potential reference stars that appear to be suitable candidates for calibrating the telescope.
We do so using the data of stars acquired through the Gemini Observatory Archive at NSF NOIRLab
and processed using DRAGONS (Data Reduction for Astronomy from Gemini Observatory North
and South). One such star is Alpha Cephei, the current focus of my research. Alpha Cephei is the
brightest star in the Cepheus constellation, making it one ideal target for calibrating the Roman
Space Telescope - provided it can be verified that it is not a part of a binary star system. We use
data reduction techniques to examine these reference stars and determine if they are part of a binary
system, as well as our degree of certainty in the result. Should we come to the conclusion that a star
is suitable for observation, then it may be added to the list of vetted targets for the Roman Space
Telescope. The approved stars will later be used to calibrate the telescope for accurate observations.<br><br>

Introduction <br><br>

Exoplanets, planets that exist outside of our solar system, are often found orbiting stars. However, imaging these
planets can be challenging as the glare of these bright stars makes it difficult to see what is nearby. That glare can be
reduced by a device called a coronagraph, one of which will be equipped on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.
Unlike a traditional coronagraph that uses an opaque disk to completely block the light of the star, the coronagraph
aboard the Roman Space Telescope is designed to create destructive interference with the light of the star (V. P.
Bailey et al. 2023). This destructive interference creates a dark hole for the telescope to image, reducing the glare
and allowing light from orbiting planets to be seen. Deformable mirrors are used to correct distortions that may be
caused as a result of such interference (V. P. Bailey et al. 2023). The coronagraph also uses a series of masks in order
to promote starlight suppression. Due to the deformable mirrors, masks, and other technological advancements that
make up the Roman Space Telescope coronograph, it is projected to have detection limits that are several orders of
magnitude more powerful than any other space-flown coronagraph (V. P. Bailey et al. 2023). <br><br>

The enhanced sensitivity of the coronagraph makes it a very powerful instrument, but it also makes it more susceptible
to noise from outside light sources. Because of this, it is imperative that the telescope remain calibrated as it makes
observations. Throughout Roman’s multiple-day exposures, stellar noise must be corrected. This can be done by
periodically slewing to a reference star, recalibrating the telescope, and slewing back to the target star (L. Pogorelyuk
et al. 2022). As a result, the reference stars being used for this calibration must not be binary stars. The presence of a
companion star causes additional light in the dark hole, interfering with the calibration (S. G. Wolff et al. 2024). Thus,
reference star vetting is necessary to ensure each reference target is a single star and not part of a binary system. In
order to compile an accurate and deep dataset for each of these reference stars, one must use the data from multiple
instruments in order to optimize the likelihood of finding a potential companion star. The Gemini Observatory’s NIRI
is one such instrument. <br><br>

We utilize data reduction techniques to clean images of stars taken by the NIRI that have yet to be analyzed. Alpha
Cephei is one example of a NIRI observed star that has the potential to be a reference star. So, we go through the
process of data reduction to ensure that Alpha Cephei is not a binary star and could be a suitable reference star. <br><br>

Methods <br><br>

Our data reduction process can be broken down into three main steps: (i) baseline data processing, (ii) psfsubtraction, and (iii) certainty analysis. Baseline data processing involves processing the raw images taken by the
NIRI to correct for any manufacturing defects in the telescope that may affect the way an image looks. For the NIRI
data, we use the DRAGONS software to complete this step (K. Labrie et al. 2023; C. Simpson et al. 2024). <br><br>

As shown in Figure 1, we use dark-frame subtraction and flat-fielding to make these corrections. Dark-frame
subtraction involves images that were taken by the telescope with the lens covered, or darks. The dark frames are
then combined into a ‘master dark’ that, once subtracted from the science frames, correct for thermal noise created
by electrons. Flat-fielding is a technique that uses images that were taken by the telescope as it was illuminated by
a uniform light source, or flats. These flat frames are then combined into a ‘master flat’ that, once removed from the
science frames, corrects for variation in the sensitivity of the pixels in the telescope. So, once the first step is complete,
we are left with clean science images that show a more accurate picture of what the star actually looks like.<br><br>

(bottom left), and master dark (bottom right)<br><br>

The second step, psf-subtraction, involves reducing the glare of the stars light on the telescope in order to better
see potential planets nearby. First, there is a 3 stage pre-processing portion: (i) create a 3-D image cube, (ii) extract
parallactic angles, and (iii) find the center of the star in each image. A 3-D image cube (x,y,time) is created with
all of the science frames so we can see how to star changes throughout time. Then, the parallactic angles of each of
the images are extracted so that we can correct for the motion of the sky. Finally, to find the center of the star in
each image we use the intersections of the glare to work around the overexposed centers of the images. Once these
pre-processing steps are complete, the images are ready for psf-subtraction to remove the glare. Our PSF subtraction
is done through a pyKlip pipeline (J. J. Wang et al. 2015) that takes the three pre-processing outputs as inputs,
ultimately resulting in one combined image called a ‘residual map’ that has aligned all the science images and removed
the glare of the star on the telescope. This stage is crucial for figuring out whether a star is binary or not.<br><br>

The final step, certainty analysis, allows us to examine the degree to which we are certain a star is not a part of a
binary system, or rather allows us to ask how bright a companion star would have to be for us to be able to identify
it. There are multiple aspects to this, but injecting synthetic planets and creating a contrast curve are the two main
parts. First, we inject synthetic planets to determine how much signal has been lost through data reduction. We
do this injection before it goes through the PSF Subtraction pipeline. Then, we run this injected image through the
pipeline in order to see how much of the synthetic planet remains visible post-PSF Subtraction. Next, we measure
the fluxes of the injected synthetic planets and use those values to calibrate a contrast curve. A contrast curve lets
us examine the light of the star as a function of separation. By doing this, we can learn about the sensitivity in our
images as well as what we could and could not have detected.<br><br>

(Right)."><br>

(Right).<br><br>

If we are able to successfully complete the full reduction process without finding a companion star, then Alpha
Cephei could be added to the final list of reference stars that will be used to calibrate Roman. However, if we find
that Alpha Cephei has a companion star, then it will be removed from the list of potential reference stars. Regardless,
once a thorough analysis has been completed for Alpha Cephei, the Roman Space Telescope will be one step closer to
being ready for observations. <br><br>

Results<br><br>

As this data and our outputs require further refinement, results are preliminary. Figure 2 (Left) shows the current
state of Alpha Cephei’s residual map. Figure 2 (Right) shows Alpha Cephei’s residual map after the data was injected
with 20 synthetic planets at separations of 85, 105, 125, 145, 165, and 205 pixels. Additionally, each separation has
been injected at a position angle of 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The innermost eight planets have been injected at
brighter fluxes in order to account for the increased noise level as they get nearer to the center of the image. Figure 3
shows the contrast curve for Alpha Cephei, created using the residual map and calibrated using the flux information
from the injected planets.<br><br>

Discussion and Conclusion<br><br>

As we analyze Alpha Cephei’s residual map in Figure 2 (Left), we have yet to find signs of a companion star in the
NIRI data. We are also seeing artifacts in the residual map, believed to be due to bad pixels the pre-PSF Subtracted
images. We hope to lessen the effects of bad pixels in the near future. Moreover, we hope to improve the star centering
that occurs during PSF Subtraction. Finding more accurate centers will allow for a cleaner PSF Subtracted residual
map.<br><br>

The contrast curve for Alpha Cephei, Figure 3, currently has more peaks than we would expect to see, likely because
of the amount of bad pixels in the pre-Psf Subtracted data. Moving forward we would like to mask these bad pixels
in the hopes of creating a cleaner residual map and, therefore, a more accurate contrast curve. The increased level
of injections as the planets get closer to the center of the image has helped to combat sudden jumps in the contrast
curve due that were caused by how quickly the noise level changes moving outward from the center of the image.<br><br>

Taking all of this into account, we have yet to detect any companions around Alpha Cephei. However, we would
like to make multiple improvements in the near future to reach a more concrete conclusion about our certainty level
in this finding. <br><br>
